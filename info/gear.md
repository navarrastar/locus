# gearing phase

**All players are put into a level together where they can see and interact with each other in the following ways:**

- Send messages (private or public)
- Add friend
- Emote
- Inspect (shows their items and stats)

**What would a system for getting stronger that has a high skill ceiling look like?** 

- Auctions
- Snake drafts

**The issue with these is they just take too long. What attributes do they have that contribute to their high skill ceiling?**

- **The notion of developing a plan:**
    - You can see the items beforehand and come up with a strategy for how you want to allocate your resources.
- **The notion of finding a diamond in the rough:**
    - There will be some powerful combinations of items that only the most skilled players will recognize.
- **They are zero-sum with your opponents:**
    - When you take an item, you are also removing it from the pool of items your opponents could have.

**How can I develop a system that has these traits, but does not take as long to carry out as an auction or snake draft?**

**Itâ€™s a blind auction system:** 

- Everyone gets 7 chips and are shown 10 items.
- For the next 60 seconds, players can place their chips on whichever items they want.
- After 60 seconds, the chips on the items are counted and whoever put the most chips on each item, wins that item. In the case of a tie, both players get the item. This means that as long as you are at least tied for having the most chips in the lobby, you can have whatever item you want by putting all your chips on it. This also means that in the first round, you can win whichever single item you want, because everyone will have the same number of chips.
- These chips carry over throughout the game and these auctions will be held periodically. This means that deciding to not bid on anything in the first round would put yourself in a very good position to win the items you want in subsequent rounds, at the cost of being weaker for the first round.
- The most chips you can ever spend on an item is equal to the number of chips the highest bidding opponent had bid on that item + 1, unless nobody bid on the item, then you get it for 1 chip. This means that if you put 10 chips on an item, someone put 2 chips on the item, and someone put 4 chips on the item, you will win that item and only spend 5 chips on it as opposed to all 10.
- At any point throughout the match, players can sell their chips for gold, but these rates should not be premium. The skilled player should only want to sell their chips for the following reasons:
    - It gives them an important power spike.
    - They are almost dead and need every ounce of power they can find.
    - They believe the game will end before another auction phase takes place.
    - For some reason reading those three bullet points reminds me of freezing the canasta deck with a red 3
    
## **What should the gear be**
- Consumables
  - Health Potion
  
- Throwables
  - Molotov
  - Fireball
  

- Passives
- Modifiers
- Skill Points
- Upgrades

**Item?** - Weapons, Actives, and Passives are considered items

**Weapons**
- Can bring one into fight.
- Consists of melee, alternate, S1, and S2 moves.

**Active Skills**
- Can bring 4 into fight.
- Just an ability on a cd.

**Passive Skills**
- Can bring 3 into fight.
- Funtionally, they are like Bazaar skills or STS relics. But in those games, you only accumulate relics and dont choose which ones to equip at any given time. So in that sense, they are similar to Dungeonborne rings with set bonuses.

**Modifiers**
- Every item can have 2 of these on it
- Functionally, they are like TFT items

**Upgrades**
- Some way to upgrade items you have, which unlocks branches of a skill tree for that item.
- Functionally, thay are like Lost Ark Tripods 
- Upgrading could happen when you come accross two items 

### **Difference between TFT and Bazaar shops**
**TFT**
- All items have the same number of levels (3)
- Only offers level 1 items.
- Each item has a rarity which combined with your level, determines the likelyhood of seeing it in the shop
- To upgrade items, you must acquire 3 of the same item, and they will combine into 1 item of increased level.

**Bazaar**
- Items have a differing number of levels
- Offers items of all possible levels. Except if you already own an instance of the item, in that case it can only ever be offered at the same level as your instance.
- The item's level combined with your level determines the likelyhood of seeing it in the shop
- To upgrade items, you must buy the item again from the shop, and they will combine into 1 item of increased level.

**General idea**
After every fight, this is what happens:
- A wheel is spun that determines how many skill points are given out to everyone.
- Each player is awarded a Chip.
- The Chip Auction is held. (Shown 3 tft items)
- The player is shown 

**Match Start**
- Each of the 8 players are shown the same 5 elements (there are 10 elements total), and they
choose which one to start the match with.
- Each element has an associated ring that is always given when the element is chosen, as well
as a ring that is randomly assigned to it
